# Xbox-One-Emulator-or-smth
(Don't wait nothing of it, please.)

I'm currectly studing the Durango CPU, GCN architecture (GPU) and the game files extension when i have free time so don't expect an result to early. (i'm also studying C++ and other languages)

What i already did

-Implemented SDL.


*What i'm doing*
*-Very important: Decrypting an Xbox One game to see how they are*


What i still need to do

-Everything.

-Maybe emulate Xbox Live since you need an Xbox Live profile to play, but for now i have to worry about emulating the CPU, GPU, audio and RAM.
